/**
 * FifoLots — pure, framework-agnostic FIFO lot accounting for one security.
 *
 * Buys open lots; sells consume the oldest open lots first (FIFO), realising
 * P&L on the matched quantity. Fees are folded into cost (buys) and netted
 * from proceeds (sells). Leftover open lots carry the remaining cost basis.
 *
 * Honesty note: if the order history is incomplete for some instrument
 * (e.g. transferred in from another broker), a sell with no matching buy in
 * the data leaves an "unmatched" quantity that we do NOT fabricate a cost for
 * — it's excluded from realised P&L and surfaced as coverage, so the number
 * is never silently wrong.
 *
 * Arrays in, arrays out — no OCP/OC dependency (the portable núcleo).
